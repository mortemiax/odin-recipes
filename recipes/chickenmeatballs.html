                    <li><strong>1</strong> pound ground chicken</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Sauce</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>15</strong> Roma tomatoes, cut in half lengthwise</li>
                    <li><strong>1</strong> onion, quartered</li>
                    <li><strong>2</strong> tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li><strong>8</strong> cloves garlic, peeled</li>
                    <li><strong>1/2</strong> teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

                    <li>shaved Parmesan, for garnish</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>350</strong> degrees F (<strong>175</strong> degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet. Add onion and garlic, season with <strong>1/4</strong> teaspoon salt and <strong>1/4</strong> teaspoon pepper, and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
                    <li>Combine panko and ricotta in a bowl and mix well. Add egg and season with remaining salt, pepper and Italian seasoning; mix to combine. Add ground chicken, and cooked onion and garlic mixture; mix gently to combine.</li>
                    <li>Shape into about 24 meatballs and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <strong>165</strong> degrees F (<strong>74</strong> degrees C),  about 20 minutes; remove to cool.</li>
                    <li>To make the sauce, preheat the oven to <strong>425</strong> degrees F (<strong>220</strong> degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Coat the tomatoes with olive oil, then place cut side down in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Add onion and garlic cloves to the baking sheet and sprinkle everything with salt.</li>
                    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tomato skins begin to shrivel and tomatoes begin to release their juice, about 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove and let cool slightly. Carefully discard the skins.</li>
                    <li>Place tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a blender and blend to your preferred consistency. Stir in Italian seasoning and serve with chicken meatballs. Garnish with basil and shaved Parmesan.</li>
                </ol>
